## Bonestrap

A Wordpress Development Theme combining the best from Themble Bones and Twitter Bootstrap

------

Bonestrap is intended to be used by custom Wordpress developers. It uses the very sensible theme setup of Themble Bones theme but includes Twitter Bootstrap 3's grid system and other nifty style and functionality tools. It is expected that developers will remove specific Bootstrap CSS and Javascript components as they are deemed unnecessary.
